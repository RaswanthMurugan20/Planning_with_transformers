    Status: 
    Action loss stagnating at 9.4
    evaluated avg reward: -171

    TODO:
    1. Plot computed actions with states to verify correctness of data - Data seems to correct
    2. Verify rtg - Done
    3. Verify contgridV5 env. Possibly the reason why cirriculum learning is also not working
    4. Finsish any left over 'todo' in code 

    ---- Problem solved -------
    Solved on 26 aug. Tanh at the last layer restricted op to [-1,1]. 
    network is overfitting now with done trajectories
    Check run: my-dt-DG3_dummy__08-26-14-31

    TODO:
    1. make proper plots at evaluation and log to wandb 
            - Done. Needs modification for plotting all trajs
    2. Save most recent trajecttory plots to tmp/last_exp_figs/
            - Done
    3. Process data on separate realizations, not just on mean field
            -
    4. Train with train, test, validataion  split
