    Action loss stagnating at 9.4
    evaluated avg reward: -171

    TODO:
    1. Plot computed actions with states to verify correctness of data - Data seems to correct
    2. Verify rtg
    3. Verify contgridV5 env. Possibly the reason why cirriculum learning is also not working
    4. Finsish any left over 'todo' in code
